# Netflix Clone

Welcome to my Netflix clone project! This is a static web page built using HTML and CSS to replicate the look and feel of the Netflix homepage. While this project is not hosted, you can run it locally on your machine to explore the design.

## Features

- Responsive design: The page adapts to various screen sizes.
- Header section: Includes navigation links, a sign-in button, and an email sign-up form.
- Features section: Highlights key features with images and descriptions.
- FAQ section: Provides answers to frequently asked questions.
- Footer: Contains useful links and contact information.

## How to Use

1. Clone this repository to your local machine or download the ZIP file.
2. Open the `index.html` file in your web browser.
3. Explore the Netflix-like interface.
4. Use the email sign-up form to simulate creating or restarting a membership.
